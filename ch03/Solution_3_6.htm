             Marco Casario Profile
          </h1>
          <p>
           Marco has been passionate about informatics since he was little more than a child and used to program games in Basic for Commodore 64 before dedicating himself, while still very young, to innovative projects for the web using Flash and Director.
In 2001, he began to collaborate with Macromedia Italy. Since that year he has produced and headed a long series of presentations, conferences and articles, which you can find listed in detail in his blog (casario.blogs.com), which is currently receiving several thousands of unique visitors every day.
